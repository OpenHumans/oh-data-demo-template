      This is a demo app which connects a data source to your
      <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/">Open Humans</a> account.
      Update this section to introduce your source. The remaining
      text below can be kept as it is, but remember to replace the
      placeholder 'source' with the name of the data source you are
      integrating, and to add your name and contact information at the
      bottom of this page.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Will my data from 'source' be public?</b><br>
            <b>The short answer</b>: No, by connecting your account you don't agree
            to make your data public or give anyone access to this data.
            It will be stored in your Open Humans account and you decide with whom to share.<br>
            <b>The longer answer</b>: It can be public if you want it to be public.
            If you're logged into Open Humans <a href='https://www.openhumans.org/public-data/'>
              can make individual sources publicly available
            through the public data feature</a>.
          </li>
          <li><b>Do you keep my data up to date?</b><br>
            Yes, we regularly update your data to keep it up to date.
          After logging in you can also manually trigger an update.</li>
          <li><b>Who's running this project?</b><br>
